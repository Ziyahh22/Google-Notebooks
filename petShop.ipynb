        "I connected the pet entity to the enclosure entity because pets are kept in enclosures, and there would be 1 pet in an enclosure but 0 to 25 enclosures occupied. Also the pet transactions were connected to pets because the adoption rate of pets are logged in the pet transaction, there will only be one transaction for a pet but 0 to 25 pets can be adopted.  The pet and food entity was also connected because pets are fed food and 1 pet eats one food but there can be 1 to 25 types of food for any 1 pet. Food transactions are connected to food also, because the food purchases are recorded in the transactions, there can be 1 to 25 types of food purchased but only  transaction recorded for each food.Customers and food are connected because customers are able to purchase food because a customer most likely comes to  pet store to buy food even if they dont adopt a pet because they have other pets at home . Lastly the customers are connected to the loyalty program because they join the program, one customer can join the program 1 time and 0 to 25 customers join meaning not all has to join or there is a chance that none might join.\n"
